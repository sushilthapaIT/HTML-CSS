        <h4>About this Legend</h4>
        <ol class="center">
            <li>King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev (1945-2001), the son of King Mahendra and the grandson of King Tribhuvan, ruled as an absolute monarch from 1972 to 1990. He was very popular and regarded as liberal and a “gentle king” and a “nice guy” who liked a good cigar and helped establish Nepal as a popular tourist destination. He was assassinated along with much of his family by his son in 2001.</li><br>
            <li>King Birendra (ruled 1972–2001) took the throne at the age of 27 after King Mahendra died suddenly in January 1972. He adopted a more liberal approach to government. Amid student demonstrations and anti-regime activities in 1979, King Birendra called for a national referendum to decide the nature of Nepal's government — either the continuation of the Panchayat system —a partyless political system of local governments under the direct rule of the king — with democratic reforms or the establishment of a multiparty system. The referendum national was held in May 1980. The king interpreted the narrow margin of support for the panchayat system (54.7 percent voted in favor) as a need for political change. The King carried out the promised reforms, including selection of the prime minister by the Rastriya Panchayat. <strong>[Source: “Countries of the World and Their Leaders” Yearbook, Gale, 2009; Library of Congress, November 2005]</strong></li><br>
            <li><strong>From a very young age, Birendra</strong> was described by his school teachers as kind and emotional and was described as one of the few Nepalese monarchs who wanted the Nepalese people to experience real democracy. Some historians have speculated that King Birendra's democratic views and simple nature led to the success of the People's Movement I (1990). [3] He is credited for introducing SAARC in Asia in order to strengthen the foreign relations of Nepal with the other South Asian countries. <strong>[Source: Wikipedia]</strong></li><br>
            <li>King Birendra provided be a somewhat stabilizing force as Nepal became more democratic. He often mediated during political crises and dedicated himself to upholding democratic principles and was largely credited with strengthening rather weakened democracy. Other efforts to modernize endorsed by the king included the creation of secular schools, development and expansion of irrigation to improve agricultural yields and the launching of a manufacturing belt along the Indian border.</li><br>
